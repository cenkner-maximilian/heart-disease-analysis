# 📊DATA ANALYSIS |  🫀 Heart Disease Data

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a public heart disease dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal of this project was to explore potential **associations** between selected health indicators and the presence of heart disease, while applying sound data analysis practices and careful interpretation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:

- 💤 Is there a relationship between **sleep duration** and:
  - Blood pressure?
  - Cholesterol levels?
- 🧬 Is heart disease more common in people with **higher or lower homocysteine levels**?

This project emphasizes **methodology and reasoning** over forcing conclusions, reflecting how real-world data analysis is conducted.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: Kaggle (Heart Disease dataset)
- Size: ~10,000 records
- Features include:
  - Demographic information (e.g. age, gender)
  - Lifestyle factors (e.g. sleep hours)
  - Biological markers (e.g. cholesterol, homocysteine)
  - Binary heart disease outcome
- Data type: **Observational (non-experimental)**

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Exploratory data analysis using:
  - Histograms
  - Bar charts
  - Scatter plots
- Group-based comparisons for binary outcomes  
- Conservative, non-causal interpretation of results  

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- No strong associations were observed between:
  - Sleep duration and blood pressure
  - Sleep duration and cholesterol levels
  - Homocysteine levels and heart disease prevalence
- Several variables (e.g. age and gender) appear **balanced**, suggesting the dataset may be synthetic or intentionally structured
- Null results were treated as **valid analytical outcomes**

---

## ⚠️ Notes on Interpretation

- This analysis explores **associations**, not causality
- Results are specific to this dataset and should not be generalized
- The project highlights the importance of:
  - Dataset inspection
  - Analytical discipline
  - Avoiding overinterpretation of observational data
